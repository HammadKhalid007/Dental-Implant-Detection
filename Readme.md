The Dental Implant Detection GUI is an innovative computer vision project designed to detect different types of dental implants on radiograph images of teeth. Leveraging the power of YOLO_v7, this project has been trained on a carefully curated dataset of around 2000 radiograph images, enabling it to accurately identify and categorize three major types of dental implants: Endosteal, Subperiosteal, and Zygomatic.

Key Features:

Robust Implant Detection: The YOLO_v7 model has been meticulously trained to detect Endosteal, Subperiosteal, and Zygomatic implants with exceptional precision, making it a reliable tool for dental professionals.

User-Friendly GUI: The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive and user-friendly platform for dental practitioners to upload and analyze radiograph images effortlessly.

Real-Time Inference: The model's real-time capabilities enable swift detection and classification of implants, streamlining the dental diagnosis process and saving valuable time.

Interactive Results: Upon detection, the GUI highlights and labels the identified implants on the radiograph image, providing dentists with clear and actionable insights.

Enhanced Diagnostics: With the ability to identify different types of implants, the Dental Implant Detection GUI empowers dental specialists to make informed decisions for personalized patient care.

How to Use:

Open the Dental Implant Detection GUI.
Upload the radiograph image of teeth to be analyzed.
Click on the "Detect" button to initiate the detection process.
The GUI will display the detected implants, categorized as Endosteal, Subperiosteal, and Zygomatic, highlighted on the radiograph.

How to Contribute:
